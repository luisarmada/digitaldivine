    <h1>Analysis of Persona 3: Portable</h1>
    <p>Persona 3 Portable is a spinoff of the Shin Megami Tensei series (SMT). This particular version of the game is a rerelease on the PlayStation Portable, with the original version (Persona 3) being available on PlayStation 2 in Japan in 2006, and North America in 2007. P3P was released in 2009 (JP) and 2010 (NA), and finally in Europe in 2011. It was ported once more to modern consoles in 2023. The SMT series is known for its disturbing tone and the use of demonic and mythological references and settings, and the Persona series has similar references. In P3P, the player becomes affiliated with the Specialised Extracurricular Execution Squad, a group of fellow students who are investigating the Dark Hour. During the Dark Hour, a tower known as Tartarus spawns which contains monsters called Shadows. SEES call upon a physical manifestation of their psyche called a Persona through firing a gun-like object called an Evoker at their head. P3P has two kinds of gameplay that the player alternates between at Day and Night - simulation and role-playing games. Both kinds of gameplay interact with one another and the player must find a balance between the two to ensure a smooth playing experience.</p>

<p>To understand what will be discussed, spoilers of the game’s plot must be shared. Throughout the game, SEES works to destroy 12 greater Shadows that were born out of an experiment, since they were told that their destruction would mean that Tartarus and the Dark Hour would cease to exist. However, destroying the greater Shadows actually resulted in parts of Nyx being free, a being who would bring the end of the world if fully restored. She is the creator of Shadows and was drawn to Earth by the Appraiser, or Death. </p>

<p>SEES encounters the Appraiser in the form of Ryoji Mochizuki, a transfer student. It is revealed that the experiments created him as the Death Shadow, albeit incomplete. Aigis, a member of SEES, couldn’t defeat the Shadow at the time and so sealed it within a passerby - the protagonist, who was a child. Ryoji insists that Nyx cannot be defeated and Earth’s fate is sealed. He offers his own life in exchange for the erasure of SEES’ memories of the Dark Hour and Tartarus so that they could live their remaining days in blissful ignorance. </p>

<p>The player must decide whether to accept Ryoji’s offer or not. The bad ending will trigger if the player accepts, as the game cuts to Graduation Day showing members of SEES, except for Aigis, losing their memories and living unaware of Nyx’s coming. If Ryoji is spared, the game extends for one more month in which the player must ascend to the top of Tartarus to confront then defeat the Nyx Avatar (Ryoji) and Nyx herself. The protagonist will awaken the power of the ‘Universe’ which gives him the ability to seal Nyx away.  </p>

<h2>Social Links</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Social Links are the game’s main feature for its dating simulator gameplay. The player will have opportunities to spend time with a specific character one on one from a strong selection, each representing a Major Arcana. Players are offered choices based on external dialogue stimuli that either increases, decreases or doesn’t affect the affinity the player has with a certain character. Social Ranks can be levelled up, up to a max of 10. Though Social Links are not inherently religious (though The Tower Social Link is built with a worldly monk), they still play a part in the game’s religious representations.</li>
<li>The building and deepening of relationships with your comrades plays into the Knight of Faith and Messiah allegory. Social Links make the player feel as though they have to earn the faith that is eventually placed on Makoto in the later stages of the game by his Knights of Faith (the SEES members). If a player forgoes working on their Social Links (even the ones that aren’t SEES members), they lose out on substantial character development for several characters that enhance the experience of gaining the Universe Arcana, playing into the idea of a game’s spatiality allowing for deeper immersion (Heidbrink, Knoll and Wysokci, 2014). Furthermore, to link it to the Messiah allegory, Makoto’s efforts to earn the trust of his team can be likened to Jesus trying to gather followers during his time on Earth. </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Messiah of the Fall </h2>
<ul>
<li>The game world’s fate to the Fall parallels the purpose of Jesus being sent to Earth. Born into flesh and blood, Jesus’ purpose was to be sacrificed as an offering, so that humanity would be saved from eternal damnation and separation from God. Yet, even Jesus had his reservations, seen in Luke 22:42 - “Father, if You are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.” He understood that it was his duty but would still like to be spared from his painful yet temporary death. </li>
<li>In the same vein, Makoto (the player) had to decide whether or not to try and save the world from the Fall in what appeared to be a fruitless endeavour. The decision falls on him as he gained the trust of the SEES members. In the True Ending route, Makoto chose the ‘absurd choice’ and resolved to try and fight Nyx. In that fateful fight, he would have to eventually give up his life to seal Nyx away and save humanity.</li>
<li>Jesus had his reservations and Makoto was offered a way out, but both decided to do what was best for the greater good and sacrificed themselves. </li>
<li>Ryoji was also willing to become a sacrifice, as his death would lead to the SEES members forgetting all that transpired throughout the course of the game. He had already given up on any hope that humanity had a chance against Nyx (as he is the human manifestation of Nyx’s power and so arguably understood her more than most). However, unlike Makoto’s selfless choice of sacrifice, Ryoji’s sacrifice was ultimately selfish in nature, as only he alone would find freedom while the rest of humanity goes through the Fall. The game clearly signposts that accepting Ryoji’s offer is the wrong choice as well. </li>
</ul>

<h2>On Personas and Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The inspiration of Personas being mythological, divine and demonic beings comes as no surprise to fans of the Shin Megami Tensei series, as Persona is a spin-off of it. </li>
<li>I personally found no offence caused by the game’s depictions of these beings. P3P was developed by a Japanese company, and religious syncretism is common in Asia with deep roots in Japan (Fiadotau, 2017). This culture is reflected in how Personas are a big blend of multiple faiths into one system.</li>
<li>While the designs, particularly with those from Judae-Christian theology, do play into stereotypical representations of religion (eg. Principality from the Justice Arcana and Satan from the Judgement Arcana) and the distinction of ‘good’ and ‘bad’, they are equal in function. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Analysis of Honkai: Star Rail</h1>

<p>Honkai: Star Rail is a role-playing gacha video game developed by miHoYo, published by miHoYo in mainland China and worldwide by COGNOSPHERE, d/b/a HoYoverse. It was released internationally in April 2023 for Windows and mobile devices, then on PlayStation 5 in October 2023. It features the main character, referred to as the Trailblazer, travelling across worlds with the Astral Express to help connect them to one another. They also assist in resolving Stellaron disasters, or problems caused by other parties.</p>

<p>To understand the following section, I will summarise the concept of Paths. Paths are essentially the game’s fictional religions, and followers of a Path are called Pathstriders. Furthermore, these Paths double as categories for playable characters (wherein it will be referred to as Class Paths) so that the player can quickly identify a character’s main function. In terms of lore, Paths are congregations of Imaginary energy that are born as manifestations for universal philosophical concepts. There are seven Class Paths available currently, and 11 other Paths. A Path is ruled over by its respective Aeon, entities that intertwined themselves completely with a Path and explored its concepts entirely.</p>

<p>Here are the seven Class Paths, their role in gameplay and their Aeon:</p>

<ol>

<li>The Preservation - Provides defensive utility to the team in the form of shielding or tanking. Its Aeon is Qlipoth.</li>

<li>The Abundance - Provides healing to the team. Its Aeon is Yaoshi.</li>

<li>The Hunt - Specialises in single-target damage. Its Aeon is Lan.</li>

<li>The Erudition - Specialises in Area-Of-Effect (AOE) damage, dealing with multiple targets. Its Aeon is Nous.</li>

<li>The Destruction - The balance between The Hunt and Erudition, excels in almost all situations. Its Aeon is Nanook.</li>

<li>The Harmony - Provides offensive buffs to the team. Its Aeon is Xipe.</li>

<li>The Nihility - Inflicts debuffs and Damage-Over-Time (DOT) on the enemy. Its Aeon is IX.</li>

</ol>

<p>Here are the 11 other Paths with their Aeons.</p>

<ol>

<li>The Trailblaze and its Aeon, Akivili</li>

<li>The Elation and its Aeon, Aha*</li>

<li>The Remembrance and its Aeon, Fuli*</li>

<li>The Beauty and its Aeon, Idrila</li>

<li>The Permanence and its Aeon, Long</li>

<li>The Propagation and its Aeon, Tayzzyronth*</li>

<li>The Order and its Aeon, Ena</li>

<li>The Enigmata and its Aeon, Mythus</li>

<li>The Voracity and its Aeon, Oroboros</li>

<li>The Equilibrium and its Aeon, Hooh</li>

<li>The Finality and its Aeon, Terminus</li>

</ol>

<p>*These Paths are present in a separate game mode known as Simulated Universe.</p>


<h2>World Religions Paradigm - Reductionism and Essentialism</h2>

<p>In the narrative currently, the Paths can be argued to be quite reductionist and static - for example, there hasn’t been a character that follows two Paths simultaneously though this can change in the future. Though the Trailblazer can switch Paths for combat, narratively speaking they are strictly a Pathstrider of the Trailblaze.</p>

<p>Yet the lore behind Paths is not essentialised. The Paths as religions are quite simple to understand at face value, but should they want to, players can find out more about them through reading text in places such as Collectible and Relic set descriptions.</p>

<p>The Paths as mechanics are akin to classes in RPGs and have clear, set functions that are unlikely to overlap. There are characters that are exceptions to this (eg. Acheron is a Nihility unit that deals damage with her Ultimate rather than relying on DOTs) but generally all characters adhere to their categories.</p>

<h2>Institutional Bias</h2>

<p>There is a clear emphasis on the institutions of a Path, evidenced by the differing strengths of the various factions that follow a Path. For example, the Interastral Peace Corporation of the Path of Preservation holds dominance over other planets due to their control of the galactic economy. On the other hand, the Galaxy Rangers of the Path of The Hunt are few and far between, with many regarding them as myths.</p>

<p>This focus can overlook the lived experiences and practices of ordinary adherents, as well as the significance of oral traditions and non-textual forms of religious expression.</p>

<p>Trailblazer Missions rarely spotlight NPCs that do not hold some sort of status or authority, prioritising those in or with power. This is clearly evident in the entire roster of playable characters, who each have some semblance of significance in the wider storyworld.</p>

<h2>Opposing the Paradigm</h2>

<p>However, some aspects of the Paths do oppose the paradigm. For example, as more and more characters are released, their functions have begun to tap into other Paths they are not a part of. For example, when Huo Huo was released as a Wind Abundance character, her Ultimate gave an Attack increase and a set amount of Energy, which is arguably an Ultimate reserved for a character of the Harmony path. This addresses the problem of the paradigm’s artificial boundaries that does not reflect the overlapping nature of religious identities and practices.</p>

<p>It also addresses the problem of believing that religions are static by nature. Going back to the example of the IPC, while they preach of their devotion to the Preservation, the way they go about ‘preserving’ planets is almost villainous and self-serving, and opposes the fundamental nature of the Preservation. On the other hand, the citizens of Belobog still keep true to the Preservation. The contrast between the two factions that follow the same Path but with different values shows that religion is not static and will undergo changes over time.</p>

<h2>Eurocentrism and Colonialism</h2>

<p>When playing through the game mode Simulated Universe (SU), the player can learn new things about the Aeons of the in-game universe while earning substantial weekly rewards. The player learns early on that there are more Paths that exist beyond the ones present in the ludic framework. It is unclear whether these narrative exclusive Paths will ever be playable in the same capacity, or will be adapted into the SU in the same vein as Paths such as the Path of Propagation.</p>

<p>There is clear partiality to certain Paths such as the Preservation, the Hunt and the Harmony, as portrayals of their Pathstriders show them in favourable living conditions (the IPC, Xianzhou Luofu, and Penacony Dreamscape). Other Paths such as the Order, the Propagation and the Beauty either lack Pathstriders entirely, or their traditions are kept to few practitioners.</p>

<p>The imbalance of conditions between each Path and their Pathstriders is clear evidence for the hierarchy of religions that is perpetuated by the World Religions Paradigm. While this makes for richer lore for the storyworld, the inequality between the Paths perpetuates the paradigm and should be addressed in the future.</p>
