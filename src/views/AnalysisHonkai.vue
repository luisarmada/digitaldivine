    <h1>Analysis of Honkai: Star Rail</h1>

<p>Honkai: Star Rail is a role-playing gacha video game developed by miHoYo, published by miHoYo in mainland China and worldwide by COGNOSPHERE, d/b/a HoYoverse. It was released internationally in April 2023 for Windows and mobile devices, then on PlayStation 5 in October 2023. It features the main character, referred to as the Trailblazer, travelling across worlds with the Astral Express to help connect them to one another. They also assist in resolving Stellaron disasters, or problems caused by other parties.</p>

<p>To understand the following section, I will summarise the concept of Paths. Paths are essentially the game’s fictional religions, and followers of a Path are called Pathstriders. Furthermore, these Paths double as categories for playable characters (wherein it will be referred to as Class Paths) so that the player can quickly identify a character’s main function. In terms of lore, Paths are congregations of Imaginary energy that are born as manifestations for universal philosophical concepts. There are seven Class Paths available currently, and 11 other Paths. A Path is ruled over by its respective Aeon, entities that intertwined themselves completely with a Path and explored its concepts entirely.</p>

<p>Here are the seven Class Paths, their role in gameplay and their Aeon:</p>

<ol>

<li>The Preservation - Provides defensive utility to the team in the form of shielding or tanking. Its Aeon is Qlipoth.</li>

<li>The Abundance - Provides healing to the team. Its Aeon is Yaoshi.</li>

<li>The Hunt - Specialises in single-target damage. Its Aeon is Lan.</li>

<li>The Erudition - Specialises in Area-Of-Effect (AOE) damage, dealing with multiple targets. Its Aeon is Nous.</li>

<li>The Destruction - The balance between The Hunt and Erudition, excels in almost all situations. Its Aeon is Nanook.</li>

<li>The Harmony - Provides offensive buffs to the team. Its Aeon is Xipe.</li>

<li>The Nihility - Inflicts debuffs and Damage-Over-Time (DOT) on the enemy. Its Aeon is IX.</li>

</ol>

<p>Here are the 11 other Paths with their Aeons.</p>

<ol>

<li>The Trailblaze and its Aeon, Akivili</li>

<li>The Elation and its Aeon, Aha*</li>

<li>The Remembrance and its Aeon, Fuli*</li>

<li>The Beauty and its Aeon, Idrila</li>

<li>The Permanence and its Aeon, Long</li>

<li>The Propagation and its Aeon, Tayzzyronth*</li>

<li>The Order and its Aeon, Ena</li>

<li>The Enigmata and its Aeon, Mythus</li>

<li>The Voracity and its Aeon, Oroboros</li>

<li>The Equilibrium and its Aeon, Hooh</li>

<li>The Finality and its Aeon, Terminus</li>

</ol>

<p>*These Paths are present in a separate game mode known as Simulated Universe.</p>


<h2>World Religions Paradigm - Reductionism and Essentialism</h2>

<p>In the narrative currently, the Paths can be argued to be quite reductionist and static - for example, there hasn’t been a character that follows two Paths simultaneously though this can change in the future. Though the Trailblazer can switch Paths for combat, narratively speaking they are strictly a Pathstrider of the Trailblaze.</p>

<p>Yet the lore behind Paths is not essentialised. The Paths as religions are quite simple to understand at face value, but should they want to, players can find out more about them through reading text in places such as Collectible and Relic set descriptions.</p>

<p>The Paths as mechanics are akin to classes in RPGs and have clear, set functions that are unlikely to overlap. There are characters that are exceptions to this (eg. Acheron is a Nihility unit that deals damage with her Ultimate rather than relying on DOTs) but generally all characters adhere to their categories.</p>

<h2>Institutional Bias</h2>

<p>There is a clear emphasis on the institutions of a Path, evidenced by the differing strengths of the various factions that follow a Path. For example, the Interastral Peace Corporation of the Path of Preservation holds dominance over other planets due to their control of the galactic economy. On the other hand, the Galaxy Rangers of the Path of The Hunt are few and far between, with many regarding them as myths.</p>

<p>This focus can overlook the lived experiences and practices of ordinary adherents, as well as the significance of oral traditions and non-textual forms of religious expression.</p>

<p>Trailblazer Missions rarely spotlight NPCs that do not hold some sort of status or authority, prioritising those in or with power. This is clearly evident in the entire roster of playable characters, who each have some semblance of significance in the wider storyworld.</p>

<h2>Opposing the Paradigm</h2>

<p>However, some aspects of the Paths do oppose the paradigm. For example, as more and more characters are released, their functions have begun to tap into other Paths they are not a part of. For example, when Huo Huo was released as a Wind Abundance character, her Ultimate gave an Attack increase and a set amount of Energy, which is arguably an Ultimate reserved for a character of the Harmony path. This addresses the problem of the paradigm’s artificial boundaries that does not reflect the overlapping nature of religious identities and practices.</p>

<p>It also addresses the problem of believing that religions are static by nature. Going back to the example of the IPC, while they preach of their devotion to the Preservation, the way they go about ‘preserving’ planets is almost villainous and self-serving, and opposes the fundamental nature of the Preservation. On the other hand, the citizens of Belobog still keep true to the Preservation. The contrast between the two factions that follow the same Path but with different values shows that religion is not static and will undergo changes over time.</p>

<h2>Eurocentrism and Colonialism</h2>

<p>When playing through the game mode Simulated Universe (SU), the player can learn new things about the Aeons of the in-game universe while earning substantial weekly rewards. The player learns early on that there are more Paths that exist beyond the ones present in the ludic framework. It is unclear whether these narrative exclusive Paths will ever be playable in the same capacity, or will be adapted into the SU in the same vein as Paths such as the Path of Propagation.</p>

<p>There is clear partiality to certain Paths such as the Preservation, the Hunt and the Harmony, as portrayals of their Pathstriders show them in favourable living conditions (the IPC, Xianzhou Luofu, and Penacony Dreamscape). Other Paths such as the Order, the Propagation and the Beauty either lack Pathstriders entirely, or their traditions are kept to few practitioners.</p>

<p>The imbalance of conditions between each Path and their Pathstriders is clear evidence for the hierarchy of religions that is perpetuated by the World Religions Paradigm. While this makes for richer lore for the storyworld, the inequality between the Paths perpetuates the paradigm and should be addressed in the future.</p>
