    <h1>Supplementary Information</h1>

<p>The following information is meant to expand the fictional world I’ve created, adding context, giving clarity on my thought process, and developing details. If the game was ever made to completion, I would hope that these details would be communicated to the player in some way, should they remain.</p>
<h2>The Messengers and The Original Patron</h2>

<ul>

<li>The concept of Messengers and Bearers was inspired by the Christian practice of Discipleship – in which seasoned and faithful servants of God would find others to lead to God</li>

<li>Messengers are named after Patron Saints (eg. Genesius is named after Saint Genesius of Rome) and their signature abilities are related to the Saints’ life (St Genesius was an actor, and Genesius’ ability of Replication was inspired by the idea of a One Man Play, where Genesius would have to play all the roles himself)</li>

<li>This inspiration came from the story of Joan de Arc who rose up to lead the French army but still faced a betrayal by them</li>

<li>Messengers are akin to angels of God (seen in their design and loyalty to the Original Patron) and are the Defenders of the Heavens</li>

<li>There were two kinds of Origin Stories for them – either they were significant, faithful humans who rose to the position of a Messenger through the appointment of the Original Patron Herself, or they were simply pieces of the Original Patron to mirror the Lingering and Tiamat</li>

</ul>
<h2>Her Opulence, Magnificent and Pure</h2>

<ul>

<li>The mythos of the Original Patron was heavily inspired by the Christian and Roman Catholic religions</li>

<li>She is an omnipotent, omniscient being said to hold reality in Her palms</li>

<li>She would have been the source of many creation myths in the world (eg. Her Gaze i.e. the Sun)</li>

<li>The decision to have a single deity be the focus of religion in the game is motivated by two things:</li>

<ol>

<li>Firstly, time constraints meant that it would be more beneficial to focus on one god (monotheism) and expand on their lore rather than creating multiple yet shallow religions and gods (polytheism)</li>

<li>Secondly, the Christian faith is widely recognisable so drawing parallels to its mythos helps players to more easily understand</li>

</ol>

<li>The Original Patron was planned to be a human from ancient days who rose up to the Heavens and found her place as its Ruler, to create a parallel to Hana’s story arc</li>

</ul>
<h2>The Lingering</h2>

<ul>

<li>The Lingering’s forms are based on animals primarily (eg. Wolves or gorillas)</li>

<li>The Superiors were planned to be animals that had traits similar to a corresponding character (eg. Kazuha’s Superior was a Serpent named Leviathan)</li>

<li>The Superiors were going to be named after demons from De Occulta Philosophia (or Agrippa’s Classification) and other well-known demons such as Lucifer</li>

</ul>
<h2>Expanding on the Narrative</h2>

<ul>

<li>I’ve already made a rough skeleton for what the whole game’s story would look like</li>

<li>The game created is only the first part of a greater narrative</li>

<li>I couldn’t make a satisfying demo without knowing what comes next so planning ahead was necessary</li>

<li>In a nutshell – the game involved Hana (MC) taking revenge on her bullies one by one while dealing with Superiors that would come about because of drastic actions done by said bullies</li>

<li>As Hana continued to enact her revenge with the aid of her newfound powers, she would slowly delve deeper into crazed arrogance and develop a god complex, believing that her suffering gave her a right to ‘fight back’ against her bullies and that she became a Bearer for this very purpose</li>

<li>Each revenge would be accompanied by the appearance of a Superior</li>

<li>The story would climax at a standoff between the Original Patron (Maradia (Marduk, Virgin Mary) and Tiamat who was revived by the elimination of Superiors throughout the game</li>

<li>I envisioned Hana undergoing a change in her personality – she started the game off as someone reserved, holding back, and mostly ‘passive’ (letting things happen to her) but by the end, I saw her as the extreme opposite of it</li>

<li>Those of a holy nature (The Messengers, Original Patron, Tiamat) were planned to stay consistent with their faith and alignment, harking back to the idea that gods do not change over the course of time</li>

<li>More details on the world can be found elsewhere</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Expanding on the Characters</h2>

<p>For brief details on what character arcs were planned for each of the characters read here:</p>
<h3>Mitsuru Iori</h3>

<ul>

<li>Mitsuru was first planned to be another bully to Hana but in a more discreet and impersonal way:</li>

<ul>

<li>Mitsuru was not a fan of how Hana made the rest of the students feel scared and so, ‘for everyone’s sake’ she thought that Hana should be driven away by any means necessary</li>

</ul>

<li>Her Superior was a Lion embodying leadership and charisma</li>

<li>Mitsuru then pivoted in character to being a Bearer all along who knew of what Hana was trying to accomplish with her Hunt</li>

<ul>

<li>Her being a Bearer was visually hinted in her unusual eye colour of red, something shared with all Bearers so far (Hana’s violet eyes and Kagura’s golden eyes)</li>

<li>This change was brought about because of two things:</li>
</ul>
<ol>

<li>I felt as though someone besides Hana’s mother and Shiro should be by her side in the capacity of a Bearer so that the Superior(s) could be defeated believably</li>

<li>Shinobu’s own arc could then be more nuanced with the new dynamic of kind aristocrat and trapped servant</li>

</ol>

<li>Being a Bearer was also meant to introduce a system in the scrapped Night gameplay in which the player could choose which character (Bearer) to control and each one would have unique animations and combo strings</li>

<li>Mitsuru would be Hana’s companion throughout the story, acting as a parallel to Shiro’s relationship with Hana</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hinata Kaneko</h3>

<ul>

<li>Hinata is actually Hana’s half sister (same mother) who left to live with her dad after the divorce</li>

<li>She resents Hana for being with her mother (Hinata’s dad is neglectful, borderline abusive) and thought it was unfair that she had to endure more pain than she did</li>

<li>Hinata would always be quite objective towards Hana – understanding what needs to be done but still having empathy for her</li>

<li>In early development, Hinata was the ringleader of all the bullying Hana endured and orchestrated each event</li>

<li>In the current narrative, Hinata would act more as an anti-hero who went about things in her own way and only sought to benefit herself</li>

<li>Her Superior was a Deer, an animal related to religious imagery</li>

<li>There was an idea that Hinata could also be a Bearer, or be something crossed between Lingering and Human that would bring back Tiamat</li>

</ul>
<h3>Shinobu Kujou</h3>
<ul>

<li>Shinobu would have gone through an underdog story, rising above her status as the Iori Lapdog and becoming her own person</li>

<li>There was an idea that Shinobu would eventually antagonise Mitsuru for her family’s treatment of her, becoming a Boss Fight</li>

<li>Shinobu as a character is similar to Hana in the sense that neither feel as though they have agency, with Hana feeling she can’t control her life while Shinobu can’t control what she does</li>

<li>Ultimately she differs from Hana and finds strength in herself to break away from Mitsuru and the Iori Family rather than in outside sources</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kazuha Nakamura</h3>

<ul>

<li>As one of the first antagonists, Kazuha wouldn’t have much time in the limelight so it was imperative that his time would impact the rest of the game</li>

<li>He was the one spearheading the rumours of Hana and would be driven to madness by the first Superior</li>

<li>His Superior was planned to be a Serpent, a symbol of deceit</li>

<li>There was an idea that Kazuha would have a tragic backstory that would explain his tendency to spread lies about others, but not much came from that</li>

<li>Had the game continued beyond the demo’s ending, Kazuha would have gone through with his plan and frame Hana for vandalising a classroom</li>

<li>He would then have been driven by the Serpent Superior to plant more lies, namely about Shiro, and bring Hana to a point of no return and begin seeking revenge</li>

</ul>
<h3>Tatsuo Yamamoto</h3>

<ul>

<li>Tatsuo, though he was quite directly involved in Hana’s bullying, never actually held any animosity against her</li>

<li>He is being blackmailed by Kazuha to do his bidding as Kazuha knows of his father’s affair </li>

<li>Tatsuo’s mother is battling cancer but is currently not receiving any professional medical treatment due to his father’s beliefs that God can heal it</li>

<li>His father projects the image of a faithful and loyal husband to the public as well as being an entrepreneur, so he could not afford for his affair to get out there</li>

<li>At the start of Day 6, Tatsuo’s family is seen praying at a church to heal his mother (where we see that Tatsuo is the oldest child of three – I never specified the amount in-game but Tatsuo has two younger siblings who are twins)</li>

<ol>

<li>Tatsuo does not participate in the prayers, indifferent to the idea that a god could heal his mother, or that there is a god at all (offering another kind of representation of faith)</li>

<li>I did not specify which god his family prays to, but many can take the background art as a sign that they are praying to the Christian God</li>

<li>I felt that adding this scene was important to once again represent the spectrum of faith but also to begin developing other characters besides Hana who by this point has been the only one we get to truly know</li>

</ol>

</ul>
<h3>Kagura Tokugawa, Bearer of Immerser</h3>

<ul>

<li>The second Bearer the player meets in game, Kagura is devoted to her duty as a Bearer and wishes to comply to Fate’s design</li>

<li>Kagura was initially planned to be another playable character rather than an antagonist, and would’ve been a founding member of the Aether Squadron alongside Hana and another character</li>

<ul>

<li>The Aether Squadron was the codename for the alliance of Bearers that would support Hana throughout the game</li>

</ul>

<li>Kagura is in a Binding Pact with Immerser</li>

<ol>

<li>He is named after John the Baptist who was also known as John the Immerser in certain Baptist Christian traditions</li>

<li>Immerser’s Authority is Immersion – The ability to conjure hyper-realistic illusions</li>

<li>Immerser would have strong associations with the sea, relating to John’s water baptisms</li>

<li>In aesthetic, Kagura and Immerser oppose one another (sea and sky)</li>

</ol>

<li>Kagura is a kendo student who carries around a wooden katana for self defence</li>

<li>She is a Sister of the Opulent Jades, and has been a member even before she became a Bearer</li>

<li>Kagura does not go to the same school as the rest of the student characters who have been introduced so far, hence her different uniform</li>

<li>She talks of guiding ‘Fate back to its true destination’:</li>

<ol>

<li>Fate’s Design is kept at utmost secrecy even to Bearers</li>

<li>However, Her Opulence has compassion to Her only believers in the modern day and so shares some details to the Opulent Jades through its Brothers and Sisters in the form of visions</li>

<li>The Original Patron revealed to the Opulent Jades a future in which they would rule with Her over humanity to lead it to a prosperous future</li>

<li>As stated in the glossary, a Bearer’s wish has the potential to alter Fate’s course and bring about a new future, and the Opulent Jades have found out about Hana’s wish</li>

<li>Kagura firmly believes that by killing Hana, Fate will be ‘fixed’ as her wish becomes undone</li>

</ol>
