    <h2>Start</h2>

<p>The game started off with a completely different concept than what it is currently. It was set firmly in the fantasy genre as it was much easier to implement religious motifs and iconographies in the environment, characters, etc.</p>

<p>The game’s narrative dealt with apocalyptic prophecies and divine saviours, with the Main Character (MC) being a vessel for a fictional god. The gameplay involved the player having to travel to four distinct areas (visually, culturally, etc) and complete quests to advance the narrative. The narrative would have been linear (Ryan, 2006) and would have included an Embedded Narrative Design (Henry Jenkins).</p>

<p>The player would interact with various fictional deities (based off of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse) and Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) who were connected to the fiction-based religion (FBR) that would have been established. These interactions would have revealed more details about the FBR and progressed the story.</p>

<p>The MC was the new generational host/sacrifice to a god destined to bring salvation to mankind from an almighty beast that consumed planets. However, there was a twist in which the god was actually the Master of the beast, and the game is actually guiding the player to collecting the lost fragments of their power so that by the end the god would be revived in their own body, more powerful than ever. In regards to the game’s ending, there was the idea of ‘when united, humanity can rival divinity’ that could have been expressed. Initial concept art for the MC was developed, envisioning her as a lone travelling swordswoman.</p>

<p>The gameplay was inspired by games such as Legend of Zelda, with a Top-Down Perspective Point of Action (Neitzel) and an Explorative Player Function (Aarseth). There was an idea to implement a Morality Meter that impacted the narrative and gameplay (Thames, 2014).</p>

<p>The idea was eventually scrapped however, due to how difficult and time consuming it would be to create a cohesive aesthetic look to the game and for how high concept it was.</p>
<h2>New Idea and New Narrative</h2>

<p>The theme of dealing with prophecies and destiny was carried on to the next game idea. This time I took more inspiration from modern JRPGs and anime, mainly the Persona series (Atlus) and the Fate series (Type-Moon). The game is now set in a modern high school setting in Japan, which allowed for an ensemble cast and more grounded narratives that could have religious undertones. The decision to move to this new setting was motivated primarily by development process and logistics – it would be far simpler to design environments and characters while also taking considerably less time to do so.</p>

<p>The new setting lent itself nicely to two storylines happening simultaneously – one involving high school drama, and the other dealing with more religious themes that can be adapted to the setting accordingly. The core idea of the second storyline is the belief in fate and karma shared across many religions, namely Buddhists, Hindus, and Christians. I was personally inspired by the saying that ‘everything has a purpose/happens for a reason’. From there came the idea of ‘going against fate’ and ‘defying your “planned purpose”’.</p>

<p>As for the ‘high school drama’, I was influenced by recent media I’ve consumed to make the narrative centre around the idea of revenge. Media surrounding a high school often deal with themes of social acceptance and identity, and I wanted to include those themes as well. I was inspired to make the storyline deal with themes of bullying, making someone an outcast and feeling like one, and power structures in school systems.</p>

<p>To tie the two ideas together, the main character would initially be guided down a path of righteousness but would be slowly consumed by desires to enact revenge on others because of the suffering they’ve been put through. This, along with the Bible verse Deuteronomy 32:35, inspired the title of the game, “The Right to Revenge”. Further details on the narrative can be found here.</p>
<h2>Implementing Religion in the Narrative</h2>

<p>The decision for the game’s religion to be fiction-based rather than based on a real one was quite difficult to make. For the sake of the research, it would make more sense to try to create a game centred around a real-life religion and experiment how to implement its teachings, iconographies, and stories. However, this kind of implementation must be done respectfully and authentically to make sure that no offence is caused by believers of the represented faith. While there are benefits in simply adapting real-life religions, I believed that my attempt to do so would have cast doubt and controversy over this project, causing more trouble than it was worth.</p>

<p>I instead opted for an approach similar to the Final Fantasy series (Square Enix), where various religious cultural heritages come to life with each other outside of the world religions paradigm (Wildt and Aupers, 2019). Furthermore, I was inspired by ancient religions – more specifically, the Mesopotamian religion, and its creation myth, Enuma Elish. I created a fiction-based religion around The Original Patron, an omnipotent and omniscient goddess responsible for reality and maintaining order. Tiamat’s name is directly lifted from Enuma Elish and the primordial sea, but I modified her myth to fit my own narrative.</p>

<p>My goal in this game’s narrative was to portray religion to be more nuanced than it is currently. Mainstream media often portray religious characters in two ways: wholly faithful, or a maniac driven by holy intentions. If it is not the two extremes, it would often be shallow and inconsequential (eg. a character’s faith would be more like a fun fact rather than something that influences their choices and behaviours). However, this is not to say that these extremes do not offer any interesting narratives, but rather a wider range of representation could be of value to both authors and audiences.</p>

<p>From this point, I decided that I wanted to show how a character’s religion/perspective on religion can influence their choices and actions. Hana Kurosawa’s arc is driven by her doubt of the higher powers that are meant to be governing her life – she is not completely devoted. This is not to say she rejects her newfound ‘faith’ but rather wants more clarity in what she is believing in, seen in how many things she questions but still accepts.</p>

<p>I want to show that a character’s faith can be nuanced – it does not have to be the two extremes mentioned previously, but rather it can be seen as a ‘spectrum of faith’ and devotion. From my own experiences, a follower of religion is almost never at the two extremes but rather going back and forth in how devoted they are. Those at the two extremes are usually exceptions to the common believer. One day they may choose to live their life strictly by the teachings of their faith, but another may involve breaking said teachings. Humans are not perfect and shouldn’t be expected to always uphold their teachings, hence why repentance and forgiveness are prevalent in various religions. The other characters in the story were also placed on this spectrum – I made it my goal for every ‘relevant’ character to have some form of relationship with religion for a variety of representations. This also includes not being on the spectrum at all, i.e. not having a faith in a god at all.</p>

 
<h2>Driven to Revenge</h2>

<p>When writing a revenge story, motivation is the most important facet to consider – what drove this character to seek revenge in the first place? Whatever drives a character to seek revenge should be impactful and powerful. The character seeking revenge should ‘resort’ to it rather than thinking of it as their first reaction. The audience must also empathise with their motivation so that they will root for that character and overlook their future actions.</p>

<p>The basis of this revenge lies in the suicide of Hana’s best friend Shiro Aikawa, the only person who treated her with kindness amidst the bullying. The bullying spread to Shiro too by association, and she couldn’t handle it after a while.
Hana was actually holding back on doing anything about her bullies per her mother’s instructions (her mother told her to do so to keep both of them safe and to not agitate the town). Shiro’s suicide and the consequences of it drove Hana to finally act for herself and seek revenge against her bullies.</p>

<p>The audience may believe that taking revenge on others is not necessarily the right thing to do, creating a juxtaposition of a righteous believer committing sinful acts. Religion is able to provide suspension of disbelief for the audience for characters committing atrocious acts (Love, 2010), providing more of a reason why these two plotlines intersecting can work. There is also the idea that can be entertained that Hana actually believes that seeking revenge is the right thing to do to honour Shiro’s kindness, and her new holy alignment gives her more justification in thinking that way.</p>

<p>Hana’s position on the spectrum of faith is similar to many believers today, wherein they ebb back and forth in their beliefs. Her committing to the Hunt and aiding the goals of the Original Patron is a sign of her faith in Her cause. However, this faith becomes twisted when combined with her desire to seek revenge and eventually she is driven to an extreme on the spectrum. There was an idea that the player would actually have the choice whether or not to seek revenge but I decided that a more linear narrative is easier to manage, and removing that choice signals to the player that Hana is ultimately her own character rather than an avatar to express themselves through.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>For gameplay, The Right to Revenge is categorised in the Visual Novel genre. Before more is discussed about why this particular genre of game was chosen, I wanted to discuss the original idea for gameplay.
There was once a greater vision that was inspired by the Persona series in the way it is a combination of two genres. It was planned to be a social simulator in the Visual Novel style and sidescroller beat ‘em up. The two gameplay styles were split by a Day and Night cycle, with the Day being the visual novel and the Night being the sidescroller.</p>
<h3>Day and Night System</h3>

<p>The two styles of gameplay were motivated by narrative – Hana would be living a double life as a student and Bearer and the game would have reflected this.</p>

<p>In the Day, the game would be set in the style of a Visual Novel with a reliable Extra-Heterodiegetic Narrator (Genette 1980), meaning that the narrator is set apart from the storyworld and have no influence on its events. The Day would have an Abstract Perspective Point of Action (Neitzel) as players would be playing mainly with menus rather than in a game space (Daniel Punday). Players would engage with the game in a Textonic Function that encourages Narrative Depth (Aarseth). The kind of ergodic structure (Aarseth, 1997) the game has is hard to pin down, but it is mostly Flowchart-Based (Ryan, 2006) that follows an Enacted Narrative (Henry Jenkins), with each Day and Night cycle acting as one ‘episode’.</p>

<p>For the Night, it was a sidescroller beat ‘em up with the same kind of narrator, but this time with a Third-Person Perspective Point of Action (Neitzel). The player would control Hana, defeating waves of Lingering with a simple Combo system with the A and B buttons (due to it still being on a Gameboy platform). There would be a meter known as the Dramatic Gauge that would fill up whenever the player lands an attack, and when the gauge is full, the player can unleash a special attack known as ‘Dramatic Finisher’. There was also a Guard and Dash system to add more variety to gameplay and allow for stronger player expression in gameplay.</p>

<p>However, the ‘Night’ had to be abandoned due to time constraints and development issues again, resulting in the final demo being entirely a Visual Novel. The Night gameplay was too ambitious for only two students to accomplish in such a short amount of time, but we knew that if the game were ever to be completed it was still in the realm of possibility. What I realised during this development that it does take a lot of talent, time, and effort to build a game from the ground up and I’ve grown more respect for this craft.</p>

<h2>Game Art and Assets</h2>

<p>From the beginning, I knew I wanted to create the game’s art myself to continue working on my digital art skills. I used Procreate on the iPad to create the Character Portraits you see in game.</p>

<p>Initially I was only going to create Concept Art for the characters, and I was going to enlist the help of a friend to create the Portraits. The Portraits were meant to have at least five variations of emotions (eg. Normal, Smiling, Sad, Shocked, Angry) to help communicate tone to the player when they read dialogue. The only exception to this was Genesius, who was planned to only have one emotion (Normal) to communicate that since he was of divine nature, he was detached from humanity and lacked empathy for their troubles.</p>

<p>However, time constraints meant that there couldn’t be variations for all Portraits so the idea was scrapped entirely (though there were some made for Hana as a proof of concept). My friend also could not help with this project anymore, so it was down to me to create the portraits instead.</p>

<p>By the end of this project, I had drawn 13 Character Portraits (10 humanoid, 3 creatures). The time it took to create that many portraits helped me develop a greater appreciation for game artists and helped develop my digital art skills. I had used references for the character’s poses were used but the designs were still original.</p>

<p>The modern high school setting allowed for ‘uniformed diversity’ among the student cast, who are all sporting variations of the same uniform (Normal Boys, Normal Girls, Sports Boys, Summer Girls (with Student Council Band), Autumn Girls). Their decision to sport these variations is another way to communicate their personalities and social position within the school. For example, Tatsuo is the only student introduced wearing a sports kit as he is part of the soccer team, while Hinata wears the yellow Student Council Band as she is its president.</p>

<p>Colours and other visuals were made to draw connections between characters and connote their relationship. For example:</p>

<ol>

<li>Hana and Ms. Kurosawa both have the same hair colour</li>

<li>Hana’s necklace is the shade that is a complementary colour to her eyes, which is a gift from Shiro</li>

<li>Similarly, Mitsuru and Shinobu’s eyes are complementary colours to each other</li>

<li>Mitsuru and Shinobu are quite opposite to one another (short and long sleeved, Summer and Winter uniform) to visualise the dynamic between the two</li>

<li>Hinata and Ms. Kurosawa wear their bangs in a similar fashion</li>

</ol>

<p>To get around the issue of time constraints, we opted to use assets found online to use for backgrounds that were within our rights to use. This practice is not unfamiliar in the video game industry, with many artists willing to share their assets in exchange for payment or credit.</p>
<h2>Development Process Outline</h2>

<p>Initially I was also going to build the game myself from the ground up. It was initially going to be built on an online game builder called GB Studio as it seemed simple to use and learn. Furthermore, when the game was complete it could be played on websites on a compatible device, allowing for ease of distribution. Other engines were considered such as Unreal Engine and Godot, but the skill gap would take too long to get across in only a few months. It was more practical to either learn a simpler engine or enlist experienced help.</p>

<p>While conceptualising the game’s narrative and characters, I realised that creating the game all on my own would be too difficult/take too much time and not meet my personal standards, so I reached out to my friend. They used Unity to build the whole game, and their previous experience with the engine sped up the process.</p>

<p>The process of developing this game has taught me a lot about game development – many compromises have to be made to reach a playable product, even removing features you originally wanted. The motion to scrap the Night gameplay did not come from me but rather from Luis who understood what resources and time it would take to make it more than me. I’m glad I listened to his suggestion, otherwise this project would not have been completed in a way that was satisfactory for both of us.</p>

<p>Near the beginning of this collaboration, I had no intention to have any hand of the actual programming of the game. I wanted to focus on the conceptualisation and writing of the game, as it still needed to be polished and refined. However, I had to learn how to create interactive fiction with Inky to speed up the process once again. The script created on Inky could seamlessly be integrated into Unity which allowed for quicker updates and changes. This new skill will prove to be invaluable in the future should I wish to continue writing for original games.</p>

<p>Alpha testing was meticulously done to make sure the game worked as intended. For example, there were typos I missed across the whole script (as Inky does not have a built-in grammar checker), and some typos led to the portraits not functioning the way we wanted. More specifically, characters would be appear to be speaking the Narrator’s lines while other times the portraits did not show up at all. Portrait sizes also had to be adjusted to account for the ratio between the PNGs’ size and the screen size.
Testing helped us understand how a player would experience this game, and changes were made accordingly to make the game draw in your attention more. Adjustments had to be made to the script to account for missing assets (eg. On Day 3, location was moved from Train Platform to Streets), and dialogue had to be adjusted at some sections so that there wasn’t a wall of text to read that would bore the reader.</p>

<p><i><u>The following paragraph is a paraphrased recollection of Luis’ experience with building the game.</u></i></p>
<p>This game was his first time to collaborate with someone to create a game on this scale. He already has experience with Unity as he took part in game jams before, which sped up the development process but they were quite simple. He learned how much of a game is actually an artist’s responsibility – he believed that programming can be flexible, but without the art the player has nothing to look at besides a blank screen.</p>

<p>This applied to not only the Character Portraits and background arts, but even more so when Night gameplay was still being considered. Many art assets would’ve been needed, from the effects of attacks to the character sprites themselves.</p>

<p>While he did find it difficult at times, especially when the code wasn’t working as intended, he had a lot of fun making it. He found our open and consistent communication to be valuable during development.</p>
